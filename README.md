# zabbix

Various configuriation files im creating to assist in deployment and management of a Zabbix monitoring instance. My logic was that if I learned the in and outs of Zabbix, it would require more than just configuring a server. I could learn to create and edit various scripts including bash, powershell, and python. Maybe someday I could contribute to the project.
